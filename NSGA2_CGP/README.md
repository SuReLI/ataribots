To obtain this bots, CGP programs have been evolved using NSGA-II as evolutionnary strategy. NSGA-II has been used for multi-objective evolution as well as mono-objective. (multi-objective bots are coming soon)

The evolution was done for 1800 generations with a population of 100 individuals generating 80 offsprings at each generation.
The parameters used were : $r=0.1$, $m_{output} = 0.6$, $m_{nodes}=0.1$, $C=400$.
From CartesianGeneticProgramming.jl, add, subtract, exp, mult, abs, sin, lt, gt were used.
